# Momentum
Momentum is a 1.12.2 utility mod for Minecraft anarchy servers.

So this is a pretty old version (almost 3 weeks old, keep in mind a lot has changed since then) of the client and I intended for this version to be public. I had trouble with some obfuscating problems so I just decided to release the source because I couldn't be bothered to fix it. Some people were also calling it kami, so :/

Anyways, this was my first attempt at a custom base client so you'll likely see an unimaginable amount of spagghetti code and if-else statements. I removed some of the modules's src either because they are in a newer version of momentum or they were just pure spagghetti code. Enjoy?

# Releases
I will be releasing the obfuscated version of the client with the old crystal aura, and longjump on the discord which can be found here: https://discord.gg/4N9Pq3m

DO NOT BE EXPECT THIS TO BE UPDATED OR NEW RELEASES TO COME OUT

We have since gone private.

# Credits
A lot of the lesser modules are pasted, most of them have been rewritten in the newer version, but still I am going to credit the pasted code here.

Some code used from:

Memeszz's Aurora

Hoosier's Gamesense

Bon55's Badlion+

086's Kami

LittleDraily's HOPE
